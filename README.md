# pyfiles

The main directory for files using the WebCam is the Python folder
The numbered files named openCV use a webcam in some form.
There are other folders in the Python Folder that contain images for use in some of the openCV files

There is also included a certificates folder that contains certs to prove work done on tutorials either on AWS or with Python

There are also 2 folders with other python work:
pythonBasics folder contains some files that are just some basics of using python
vPython are python based animations using different shapes and techniques
In the IDE you will need to switch from the Python Folder to the vPython/pythonBasics folders to run these files

IMPORTANT: there are also python environments setup as we may need to switch between different versions of python when running the openCV files or the vPython files
To change the virtual environment, open powershell - run as administrator
navigate to where the Python Directory is saved (eg. cd C:\Users\Niall\Python) 
enter the line: pyAI3.6/Scripts/activate hit enter
if we need to open the other environments available use pyAI3.11/Scripts/activate or pyAI3.9/Scripts/activate (use 3.9 for the vPython folder)
